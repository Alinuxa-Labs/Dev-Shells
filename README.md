## Can I use these ?
- Yes, you can. However you are expected to understand at least fundamentals of the nix language and programming before so, as we are not responsible for individuals slapping code into their bash shell
- without overviewing possible conflicts or misconfigs. This is meant for internal use


## Dev environments
-Nodejs and postgress (Done)
